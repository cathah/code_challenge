## Initial Data Treatment

The data provided for the code challenge has been modified slightly before being included to populate the database. Staff details relating to their pay, such as IBAN and BIC, are considered PII and are high risk. As this is an application focused on inventory management and not on staff pay, there is no need to include such data here.

## Naming

Clarify models refers to data not ML
